### Overloading your attention

The internet and the persistent connectedness of people has bred a lot of amazing things for mankind. Gone are the days of having shelves stocked with encyclopedias or searching for your old friends via phonebooks. You don't even need to talk to an actual person in order to get food on the table anymore. However, as is the case with anything that becomes popular, there will come people and corporations that take advantage of that for profit. 

Nowadays, most of us have a device in our pocket a good portion of the day, probably with (at least) a few dozen apps that constantly bombard you with notifications, fighting for your attention. From hundreds of useless email subscriptions to more pointless outraged comments on social media, these action-driving pop-ups rarely provide any value and only distract us from the things that actually matter. Not only do they divert your attention from your immediate surroundings (friends, family, _a busy intersection_, etc.), but they also distract you from reflecting and gaining insights into your day and into your self. You are fed subtle biases bundled with information, which are taken as truth, often with little critical thinking or research involved from your side.

### Past & Future lives

The older millenials remember a time before cellphones became so entrenched in our lives. When you would go out with friends and actually be present. When your friends knew you for who you were **in person**. You were not defined based on your most recent political rant or pictures that you posted on Facebook, but soley based on your real and visible personality traits. You could grab your bike, go out with friends, trek through a forest, race down the street or build a tree fort in the woods. You would actually walk over to a friends house to play video games instead of playing online by yourself at home. You would go out and play sports with a group, get dirty, possibly get injured, but this built real character.

I'm not saying there's kids who don't do all of the above thanks to good parenting, but it's clearly becoming less common since there are many more technological distractions. I strongly believe that the effects and addictions of social media causes reduced introspection in oneself. It has been shown to be major contributor of depression among teens and adolescents, and it is becoming much more prevalent in our society.

### Mindless Consumption

I've caught myself in this cycle from time to time. I've been addicted to sitting and staring at my phone with such as activities such as:
 
- mindlessly scrolling through people's lives on Instagram 
- DIY ideas on Pinterest (without action)
- image dumps in Imgur 
- binge watching TV shows 
- shopping for crap that I don't really need on Amazon
- playing video games that give you "achievements" but don't contribute to any actual skills in life


> **People consume instead of creating because it's easier.**


It's easier and there's more immediate reward in doing things that are fun and mindless. But you feel like crap after. You wonder why you wasted that time when you could have been more productive. You go to sleep, you wake up, then you do the same shit over again. You end up in a vicious cyclone of addiction. You are one person versus thousands of experts and psychologists that exploit weaknesses in our brains. And they can manipulate our thoughts and actions, especially in people that lack discipline and willpower.

### Mindful Creativity

Do things that are challenging and you will feel better. Take action that will benefit your life over the years to come instead of doing what feels good in that moment. Be persistent and create a habit out of it. Be a little obsessive compulsive if that's what helps you. Even if you fail at the task, you still win as a person.

Instead of mindlessly consuming, it is better to engage in creative actions as alternatives to the above examples such as:

- meeting new people and forge meaningful connections
- pick up some tools and build that DIY project in the garage 
- shoot your own TV shows and learn up some video editing skills (or anything else useful on Udemy)
- learn to sell on Amazon or open your own online store
- learn to build your own video game
- learn to play an instrument or create your own beats
- brainstorm business ideas and build out a plan
- join a leisure sports with random people
- learn to fix something yourself

### Balancing your intentions

The point of this site is to give myself a space to meditate and get my thoughts out. A small nook that temporarily reverts the internet to a place of free-speech and a space before it was filled with advertisements and outrage culture. To get away from the distractions of life and reflect on things that are important to me. Without judgement and without the fear of cancellation. A place where I can reflect on a regular basis and try to better myself. A place to build more meaningful thought patterns so that I can take action on my deeper, more valuable passions. And to derive authentic happiness from those actions.

Everyone deserves a space to gather their thoughts, but not everyone takes the time. If you're reading this, I hope you that you will.
